The research of our group is focused on developing methodologies concerning the following key areas:
<br>

**Multivariate Quantiles**
We specialize in the development of advanced M-quantiles techniques for analyzing the multivariate distributions, going beyond traditional quantile-based approaches.
<br>
**Machine Learning**
We integrate machine learning methods into quantile regression analysis, leveraging the power of machine learning algorithms for predictive modeling.
<br>
**Quantile Graphical Models**
We develop graphical models that allow for the exploration of dependencies between variables based on quantiles, which provides robust insights into data relationships.
<br>
**Mixed Frequency Data**
We develop quantile regression models to integrate and analyze data observed at different frequencies.
<br>
**Hidden Markov Models**
We investigate the use of Hidden Markov Models in quantile regression with applications in time series analysis and more.
<br>
**Finite Mixture Models and Mixed-Effects Models**
We explore mixed-effects modeling approaches for analyzing hierarchical and nested data structures concerning a variety of empirical applications.

Our work has found application in:<br>

- **Small Area Models in Poverty Mapping**: Our research group contributes to poverty mapping by using small area models to estimate and visualize poverty levels at fine spatial scales.

- **Finance**: The methodologies developed in our group have been applied to study financial risk measures of financial index and energy commodities.

- **Longitudinal data settings**: [You can provide more information about the applications in longitudinal data settings here.]
