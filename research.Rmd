The group traces its roots back nearly two decades ago when quantile regression gained prominence as a powerful tool for analyzing data in various disciplines. As interest in quantile regression grew, the group expanded to include a dynamic and interdisciplinary mix of faculty, researchers, Post-docs and PhD students from different institutions. We also collaborate with experts from various domains, fostering a collaborative environment that promotes cross-disciplinary insights.

The group is fully committed to expanding the theoretical foundations of quantile regression, constantly exploring innovative estimation techniques and refining existing methodologies. Beyond theoretical advancements, we are actively engaged in developing practical tools and software to facilitate the implementation of quantile regression in real-world scenarios. Over the years, the group has made major contributions to the development of advanced methods, techniques and novel applications in diverse fields, such as economics, finance, epidemiology, and environmental science. This comprehensive approach underscores the group's commitment to exploring new avenues where quantile regression can offer unique insights into complex data structures.

<br>
The research of our group is focused on developing methodologies concerning the following key areas:
<br>

**Multivariate Quantiles**
We specialize in the development of advanced M-quantiles techniques for analyzing the multivariate distributions, going beyond traditional quantile-based approaches.
<br>
**Machine Learning**
We integrate machine learning methods into quantile regression analysis, leveraging the power of machine learning algorithms for predictive modeling.
<br>
**Quantile Graphical Models**
We develop graphical models that allow for the exploration of dependencies between variables based on quantiles, which provides robust insights into data relationships.
<br>
**Mixed Frequency Data**
We develop quantile regression models to integrate and analyze data observed at different frequencies.
<br>
**Hidden Markov Models**
We investigate the use of Hidden Markov Models in quantile regression with applications in time series analysis and more.
<br>
**Finite Mixture Models and Mixed-Effects Models**
We explore mixed-effects modeling approaches for analyzing hierarchical and nested data structures concerning a variety of empirical applications.

Our work has found application in:<br>

- **Small Area Models in Poverty Mapping**: Our research group contributes to poverty mapping by using small area models to estimate and visualize poverty levels at fine spatial scales.

- **Finance**: The methodologies developed in our group have been applied to study financial risk measures of financial index and energy commodities.

- **Longitudinal data settings**: [You can provide more information about the applications in longitudinal data settings here.]
