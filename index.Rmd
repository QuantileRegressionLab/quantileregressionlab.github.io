### What we do

<br> The **Quantile Regression Lab** is a dynamic and innovative team that brings together scholars from various universities across Italy and Europe, within the MEMOTEF Department of La Sapienza University of Rome. Our group is dedicated to advancing Quantile Regression modeling in a wide range of fields, including:

-   Multivariate quantiles
-   Machine learning
-   Quantile graphical models
-   Survey sampling
-   Mixed-effects models
-   Small area estimation

The methodologies developed by our group have been successfully applied, among other areas, to:

-   Time series analysis
-   Finance
-   Economics
-   Climate change
-   Poverty mapping

These results have been published in several scientific journals. For a complete list see the [Publication](https://beatricefor.github.io/quantile-website-test-pages/publications.html) page .
